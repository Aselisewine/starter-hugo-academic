abstract: |2-
   Aims: The  disparity  in  under-five  mortality  between  rural  and  urban  areas  in  Ghana  and  other  sub-Saharan African countries is a critical national      concern. The main purpose of this study is to identify and analyze the levels, differentials and key determinants of under-five mortality in Ghana based on          selected socio-economic and demographic variables. Study  Design:  This  is  an  analytical  cross-sectional  study  design  of  the  2008  Ghana  Demographic      and    Health Survey (GDHS) dataset for children. Methodology:  Under-five  Mortality  rates  were  calculated  based  on some  selected  socio-economic  and        demographic   variables,   and   segregated   into   infant   and   child   mortality   headings.   Also,   series   of multivariate Cox regression models were      fitted to these selected variables segregated into rural and urban headings. Results:  Overall,  the  likelihood  of  death  among  under-five  children  in  the    rural  areas  was  significantly higher  than  that  in  the  urban  areas  (p<0.05).  Breastfeeding, twins  and  size  of  child  at  birth  were  key              determinants  of  mortality  in the  rural areas,  but the  influence  of  region  of residence  was  similar  in both rural and urban areas. Infant mortality      rate in 2008 was 58.489 per 1000. Conclusion: Focus of child health strategies to achieving the MDG IV will be on the social and economic empowerment  of  women    through  education  and  employment.  Also,  breastfeeding  promotion  should  be encouraged.  Innovative  and  targeted  strategies  are  required  to  address    rural  poverty  and  region-specific sociocultural factors in order to improve child survival in rural Ghana, especially twin births.
