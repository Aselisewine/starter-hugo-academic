abstract: " Aims:
  The  disparity  in  under-five  mortality  between  rural  and  urban  areas  \
  in  Ghana  and  other  sub-Saharan African countries is a critical
  national      concern. The main purpose of this study is to identify and
  analyze the levels, differentials and key determinants of under-five mortality
  in Ghana based on          selected socio-economic and demographic variables.
  Study  Design:  This  is  an  analytical  cross-sectional  study  design  of  \
  the  2008  Ghana  Demographic      and    Health Survey (GDHS) dataset for
  children.
  Methodology:  Under-five  Mortality  rates  were  calculated  based  on
  some  selected  socio-economic  and        demographic   variables,   and   s\
  egregated   into   infant   and   child   mortality   headings.   Also,   ser\
  ies   of multivariate Cox regression models were      fitted to these selected
  variables segregated into rural and urban headings.
  Results:  Overall,  the  likelihood  of  death  among  under-five  children  \
  in  the    rural  areas  was  significantly
  higher  than  that  in  the  urban  areas  (p<0.05).  Breastfeeding,
  twins  and  size  of  child  at  birth  were  key              determinants  \
  of  mortality  in the  rural areas,  but the  influence  of  region  of
  residence  was  similar  in both rural and urban areas. Infant
  mortality      rate in 2008 was 58.489 per 1000. Conclusion: Focus of child
  health strategies to achieving the MDG IV will be on the social and economic
  empowerment  of  women    through  education  and  employment.  Also,  breast\
  feeding  promotion  should  be
  encouraged.  Innovative  and  targeted  strategies  are  required  to  addres\
  s    rural  poverty  and  region-specific sociocultural factors in order to
  improve child survival in rural Ghana, especially twin births. "
