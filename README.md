- 💡👉 Hello there! I’m currently working to fit a predictive model for housing in the real estate industry.  A link to this project is found on the following link: https://wisdom-aselisewine.netlify.app/post/final-project/![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89891540/145290642-5e96ba90-4c8e-4295-87d1-b5c75a0c46e3.png)

- 👉 The data set for this project were obtained from the following source: https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data/activity![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89891540/145290909-7e6cd224-9d84-4c53-ad96-c8ac17c5aadc.png)

- 👉 We fitted a predictive model to the given to be able to determine the price of a house given some features such as the location, number of bathrooms, bedrooms and the total square area.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89891540/145290995-c0caa065-ab6a-4c61-91eb-b96c8fded5f9.png)

- 👉 The project is divided into 5 sections.
- 👉 Section 1 contains the introduction, problem statement and methodology
- 👉 Section 2 contains the data preprocessing and cleaning where we tried to remove all missing values and performed variables transformations
-	👉 In section 3 we carried out an extensive data exploratory analysis. We make good use of histograms, scatter plots, boxplots and the probability distribution plot.
-	👉 This helps to further identified the distribution of our data and outliers. This also helps to know if the assumptions of the model were met.
- 👉 In section 4, we performed model training and evaluations. 
- 👉 In the preliminary stage, the data was fitted to the support vector regression, the random forest regression, decision trees regression, and the multiple linear regression
- 👉 We identified multiple linear regression, random forest regression, and the decision trees regression as potential candidates’ models
- 👉 We carried out the grid search cross-validation on the chosen models to the appropriate hyper-parameters for the corresponding models.
- 👉 We performed model selection comparing the predictive accuracy of each model.
- 👉 We also estimated the parameters of the optimal model and their corresponding p-values.
- 👉 In section 5 we provided a brief summary discussion, conclusions, and future works.
